  <p class="tk" >Hey teddy its has been a very long time i am writing a letter to you i hope you are doing great i want to tell you something i dono whether its the right time to tell you but i want to convey whats in my heart dont get panic
    its been more than a year we started to travel i still cannot able to belive that the first time i saw you was in the office room where we used to sign attendance at that time i didnt see you  approximately i saw you and yur frnd 
      was standing in that room  and yu where hiding behind her and i think i asked yur frnd what yu want and she told we are waiting to see mam and that time i didnt known yu are here for final year project and later yu joined i though yu
      are here for some kind of internship i think i didnt talk yu for certain weeks and later one day yu where asked to sit in the place where i was sitting and you will be just coming and going at that time i didnt no yurs name also later
      one day i asked you for tea break and yu where think whether to come or not after that you came and it all started with a tea and at that time only i asked your name and then conversion started we used to talk in between the cleaning time
      we use to walk at the back side of the lab and it will take more than hours and we even didnt relaise that we will speaking like that it went for months and you went for internship program for more than 3 weeks and you came back on jan month
      i came to visted yu on station after a very long gap and was very much happy in between yu went there was lot of project people came and yur sitting palce was about to go i was saving yur place like nobody try to sit on the place and somebody
      took your place before yu come i managed to put them on someother place its was very funny and later time passed we become very close we use to go long ride and short ride every day it was really very awesome moments
      at somepoint of the day i realised that i started to have feelings for you in starting i though it was infatuation and later after somedays i got clarification that its not infatuation the feelings i got for is really i have never felt this kind
      of feeling for anybody in my life you was the first person one day i was trying to tell you that i love you u where asking me to tell what yu are thinking about me at that time i came to tell you but i do no it was my first time i was trying my best
      to tell you but words was stucked in between my throat and mouth and later yu told me relax and tell me in text and i known at that point of time you known what i was trying to tell you and days went after somedays you to left the city after that you known
      what happend i had a great loss in my life yu known that i was not in a stable mindset it took me several months to recover from it now i a saying it the feelings that i had for you have never changed it has been increased day by day i love you i admire you
      and respect you a lot i missed you a lot i still used to go to the place where we used to go daily sit there for sometime whenever i use to drop u never campus i always feel that i want to spent some more time with you and i was waiting for the time to see you
       finally i reached to see you and want suprise you but everything got closped due to cretain delay in arrival i saw trying to send 4 days with you but yu had some commitments so that it was 2 days only we explored some area and after that
       we reached to your home yu gave me a nice rice with sambar and we talked lot in that short time i had to leave because of the bus and also i have some work here also so that i left otherwise i would have stayed with you itself i still love you if your are okay
       i am ready to talk to your parents also but i need sometime for it you can take your time thinking about it and let me known what yu are feeling i will wait for you but dont take to much time</p>
